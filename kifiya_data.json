This system enables a woman that are located in a remote area to open up a savings account at a nearby Kifiya service point, providing an incredibly exciting move for the future of the Company.\n“Alongside our digital finance systems we have also worked intensely on our micro insurance offering,” adds the Company. “This form of crop insurance product has emerged from satellite data and a digital platform that enables any small-holder farmers the access needed to manage their risks.”\nMicro-insurance has become a large part of the Company’s portfolio, protecting lower-income customers from the difficulties that can often be encountered when obtaining insurance policies. In return the Company requires regular premium payment that is proportionate to the expected cost of the risks involved.\n“Our micro-insurance cloud platform excitingly allows a multitude of insurance companies’ access to our products, therefore underwriting, selling and managing policies and payout claims can be handled digitally,” continues the Company. “Our digital payment platform allows for easy enrolment and premium collection, and has subsequently proven to be extremely popular in the market.”\nUnder the micro-insurance bracket there are four specific services available, including NDVI crop, index based livestock, hospital cash and funeral services.\n“The only challenge we have encountered in this service is when it comes to the smallholder farmers in Ethiopia who rely on the right weather conditions to produce their crops,” states the Company. “Therefore we have had to create ways to get around this unpredictability and the impact of uncertainty on our customers’ income.\nThe Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has provided us with a long-standing index that is used by agencies the world over, and an excellent way to monitor the occurrence of drought.\n“The NDVI provides us with an output based index and measures the current state of green vegetation, as well as the impact on vegetation the weather will have,” explains the Company. “From this technology we have created an affordable crop micro-insurance product that we are able to deliver digitally, covering our customers for weather related risk.”\nAmongst its recent developments is the Single Window Delivery Platform, based from the eService framework that was previously developed by CMC – a Tata Group Company – which Kifiya has gone on to customise and rebrand.\n“Our single window delivery platform now ensures that any service can be delivered through a single point,” affirms the Company. “In order to achieve these integrated services, we have had to use three-tier technology, with our application server acting as a bridge between the various databases of each organisation.”\nThis newly created platform will allow anyone from governmental organisations to citizen and business to consumer to utilise the services, this is with thanks to the flexibility of the system.\n“Each new breakthrough we are making at present is decreasing the costs associated with service our local market,” adds the Company. “Insurance companies such as ourselves are able to make the most of the new products available on cloud platforms, managing both claims and policies digitally.”\nThis newly embraced technology has allowed the Company to reach a market that was previously unreachable before its digital finance payment platform.\nAs it moves into the future with ever-changing technological advancements on the horizon, risk management is becoming increasingly important.\n“Our exceptional risk management allows for the transformation of finance within the agricultural sector, as well as increased productivity of the farmers,” continues the Company. “We have found our new developments have also encouraged confidence in our services from our numerous stakeholders.”\nKifiya’s stakeholders are spread across a multitude of institutions which include the Public Financial Enterprise Agency (PFEA), Agricultural Transformation Agency (ATA) – which strategically leads the support processes for the Micro-insurance initiatives, while also developing rural insurance strategies to promote rural development – the Ethiopian Insurance Corporation (EIC) and Kifiya Financial Technology.\n“At present we are working on the development and management of our micro-insurance technology platform,” concludes the Company. “We are happy with the progress being made currently and have no plans to expand beyond our current service offering for now, however, we are never far from the next big thing.”\nEmail: info@kifiya.com\nPhone: +251 116 671 579"

Kifiya Financial \nTechnology is pioneering a unique approach to the challenge through its \ndigital lending technology Qena, which connects businesses to credit \nwithout the need for collateral, leveraging new approaches to credit \nscoring.\nRecent figures show that, Ethiopia has an estimated 800,000 MSMEs of \nwhich only about 130,000 have access to credit (70% micro-enterprises \nand 40% of SMEs), and the total financing gap is estimated to be \napproximately USD $4.2 billion (https://bit.ly/3Hd0qMh).\n The gap is driven by a variety of factors, including capital investment\n and machinery requirements, a general backlog of foreign currency, and \nmuch larger working capital requirements.\nSpeaking to the challenges facing MSMEs, Thomas Bekele said: “In the \npast, we worked with Micro Finance Institutions to purchase machinery \nfor our business.  As small business owners, we haven’t had the chance \nto work with banks. That is mainly because we do not have a property \nthat we can use as collateral to borrow money. Uncollateralized digital \nlending is a great opportunity to grow our business. Once digital \nlending products start providing loans, we plan to seize the opportunity\n and expand our business by opening an outlet and buying a vehicle for \ndelivery.”\nFinancial institutions often lack platforms that enable them to \ninterface directly with MSMEs, understand their challenges, and \nco-create solutions. By bringing together leading industry experts, \nresearchers, bank senior officials, entrepreneurs, regulators, \npolicymakers, government, and other key stakeholders, the knowledge \nseminar is poised to accelerate digital lending solutions and enhance \naccess to finance for MSMEs in Ethiopia.\n“Ethiopia is embarking on transforming the financial sector and \nembracing digital first. Digital knowledge is at its centre. And \neveryone needs to partake in bridging the knowledge gap in the sector. \nThis is the beginning of a knowledge series to convene experts to \ndebate, share ideas, experiences, and lessons to provide digital \nfinancial services to small businesses and smallholder farmers,” said \nMunir Duri, Kifiya Financial Technology CEO.\nUltimately, MSMEs are central to Ethiopia’s economic growth—but a \nlack of access to capital constrains their growth. Reflecting on the \nopportunities presented by collateral-free digital lending, Samuel \nAdela, Country Head, Ethiopia at the Mastercard Foundation said: “The \nbottom line here is not just profit for businesses—it is an opportunity \nfor Ethiopians, particularly young Ethiopians. This is about unlocking \nthe potential of MSMEs to deliver critical products and services, fuel \nthe economy, and create jobs that allow individuals to build dignified \nand fulfilling lives.”\nEmail: info@kifiya.com\nPhone: +251 116 671 579"

This is necessary for us in order to alleviate the shortcomings in this space so as to provide financing for those who badly need it for their operation and economic growth of the country,” said Frezer Ayalew, Director for Banking Supervision Directorate of National Bank of Ethiopia.\nKifiya is pioneering a unique approach to the challenge through its digital lending technology, Qena, which connects businesses to credit without the need for collateral, leveraging new approaches to credit scoring.There are a total of 850,000 MSMEs in Ethiopia, which created a total 4.5 million jobs, while only about 130,000 have access to credit and the total financing gap is estimated to be approximately USD 4.2 billion.Frezer highlighted that there is about 350,000 credit accounts in the country which is a drop in the ocean when compared with the 72.3 million deposit accounts registered in the various financial firms.“Of the stated credit accounts, 44 percent of the borrowers are duplicating borrowers of the entire banking sector credit,” he says, adding, “when it comes to the number from the borrowers 0.6 percent only takes the great chunk of portfolio.”Frezer said that the regulatory body is initiating policy frameworks to flourish the credit provision for MSMEs including the use of the uncollateralized schemes.Currently, MSMEs are mainly accessing credits from microfinance institutions.“This is the beginning of a knowledge series that seeks to convene experts to debate, share ideas, experience and lessons to provide digital financial services to small businesses and smallholder farmer,” Kifiya’s CEO expressed as he suggested way forwards in bridging the knowledge gap in the sector.The knowledge sharing session saw policymakers, sector actors and MSMEs share a flurry of ideas for the betterment of the sector.\nEmail: info@kifiya.com\nPhone: +251 116 671 579"

        "title": "Largest-ever micro-insurance payout made to Ethiopian pastoralists - Kifiya Financial Technology",
        "content": "Sources https://news.ilri.org/2017/09/18/largest-ever-micro-insurance-payout-made-to-ethiopian-pastoralists/\nMore than 2,250 pastoralists received insurance payouts following the extremely poor rains this year in southern Ethiopia. Low levels of rainfall have led to the loss of approximately 300,000 livestock in 2017 in the Borana zone of the southern Oromia region. The insurance payouts of more than ETB 5.233 million (USD 220,000) was the largest-ever micro-insurance indemnity made in Ethiopia. Each insured pastoralist received an average of ETB 2,255 (USD 96), which will allow the herders to purchase feeds for their surviving animals and to restock their herds.\nPastoralists in northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia have been insured by an index-based livestock insurance (IBLI) scheme devised in 2008 by the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) and its technical partners at Cornell University and the University of California at Davis. The Ethiopian component of this project was underwritten by the Oromia Insurance Company and introduced to eight districts of Borana in August 2012.\n‘This project is protecting farmers in southern Ethiopia’, said Siboniso Moyo, the ILRI director general’s representative in Ethiopia. ‘Our evaluation conducted in Kenya and Ethiopia indicated that in times of drought households possessing livestock insurance are less likely than others to reduce their nutritional intake. We also found that insured households make fewer distress sales of livestock assets and rely less on food aid than non-insured households. This payment is proof that the index-based livestock insurance system works here in Ethiopia.’\nAndrew Mude, ILRI’s IBLI project leader, stated that this year’s payout is the fifth, and largest, since the establishment of the project in Ethiopia in 2012. It took place on 5 September 2017 in Moyale town, the second largest in Borana. The number of insured farmers has steadily increased since the project’s inception. Since August 2012, more than 6,000 pastoralists from 10 districts throughout Borana have purchased the IBLI product.\nIBLI-insured pastoralists receive a payout based on the numbers of livestock predicted to die when a season’s available forage falls below a certain level, as assessed by satellite imagery. Such insurance payouts protect pastoralists from having to make distress sales of livestock and to take other drastic measures to generate emergency cash for food and other essentials.\n‘Insured households are seeing that for a relatively small investment, their livelihoods are much better protected’, said Masresha Taye, IBLI’s project coordinator in Ethiopia. ‘Insuring one small ruminant costs less than ETB56 a year, a head of cattle less than ETB333 and more expensive camels less than ETB560 per animal. In contrast, severe droughts—which in recent decades have become more frequent and more intense in the Horn of Africa—have caused catastrophic herd losses. This insurance payment helps herders invest both in their animals and in their families’.\nThese initial results suggest that IBLI provides Ethiopia’s pastoral livestock herders with a valuable safety net in times of drought. IBLI has managed to help Ethiopia’s herders raise their livestock productivity and income both. Households having purchased IBLI, for example, made higher veterinary expenditures than non-insured households to maintain their livestock productivity, thereby increasing the total and per head incomes they received from milk sales.\nThe ILRI-led IBLI project works closely with the Oromia Insurance Company, which is underwriting the insurance policies, with Kifiya Financial Technology Plc, which is providing digital financial service support, and with research partners at Cornell University and the University of California at Davis. IBLI is funded by the United States Agency for International Development and the Australian foreign aid organization AusAID. The UK Department for International Development funds a local IBLI partner, Community Initiative Facilitation and Assistance Ethiopia, to provide livestock insurance at discounted rates to pastoralists in two Borana districts.\nEmail: info@kifiya.com\nPhone: +251 116 671 579"

Abdishu Hussien, officially unveiled the Efoyta digital lending product alongside the distinguished guest of honor, Alganesh Tesema (PhD).

        "title": "Kifiya Becomes First Ethiopian Fintech to Receive Prestigious “Product Innovation of the Year” Award at the Global SME Finance Awards 2024 - Kifiya Financial Technology",
        "content": "Addis Ababa, Ethiopia – September 19, 2024 – Kifiya, a leading AI-powered, alternative data-driven scoring, embedded finance, and AgTech company, has been awarded the prestigious Silver Award in the Product Innovation of the Year category in Africa at the Global SME Finance Awards 2024, held as part of the Global SME Finance Forum in São Paulo, Brazil on September 17, 2024.\nThe Global SME Finance Awards, organized by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the SME Finance Forum, recognizes and celebrates institutions that have delivered innovative products and services and achieved impressive results in expanding finance and services to SMEs. Kifiya is the first Ethiopian company to win this award. This recognition highlights the company’s commitment to building a digitally and financially inclusive future by leveraging AI and cutting-edge technology to bridge the credit and market access gap in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n“Receiving this award reflects our ongoing dedication to empowering African MSMEs, SHFs and low-middle-income individuals through AI-powered and data-driven solutions,” said Munir Duri, CEO and founder of Kifiya. “This also demonstrates Ethiopia’s new-found drive for innovation led by the reforms instituted by our Prime Minister, Dr. Abiy Ahmed, which have created an enabling environment and policies that foster and encourage innovation, allowing companies like ours to thrive.”\nAfrica’s SME sector, which represents up to 90% of all businesses and provides 60% of total employment, is crucial in driving economic growth for the continent. However, many SMEs struggle with limited access to finance, a challenge that Kifiya is tackling head-on. By providing digital platforms that improve market access and address the financing needs of these businesses, Kifiya is unlocking new growth opportunities.\nIn Ethiopia, where 50% of the adult population remains unbanked, Kifiya’s financial solutions create pathways for thousands of SMEs to access much-needed credit and financial services. The company’s efforts have led to increased financial inclusion, stability, and growth for local businesses, contributing significantly to Ethiopia’s economic development.\nKifiya’s AI-powered alternative credit scoring and rating technology infrastructure solves the challenges of MSMEs’ lack of collateral and credit history, enabling them to be credit-scored and access uncollateralized credit for the first time in Ethiopia. One of the earliest successes of rolling out this infrastructure was a partnership with the Cooperative Bank of Oromia, which introduced a digital lending product that has enabled close to 300,000 MSMEs to access over $100 million in uncollateralized credit to date.\nKifiya’s intelligent embedded finance tech infrastructure enables banks to originate, extend, manage, and collect uncollateralized digital credit and provide Sharia-compliant financial products relevant and appropriate to MSMEs in agri-food systems, manufacturing, and service sectors. The platform enables FinTechs and businesses to embed inventory credit and BNPL financial services, digitize eCommerce trade processes, and provide MSMEs with inventory credit.\nThe company also offers an AgTech platform that digitizes smallholder farmers, enabling them to access credit, inputs, markets, and microinsurance to protect against climate-related risks and improve productivity. To date, more than 1.5 million smallholder farmers in Ethiopia have accessed more than $10 million of agricultural inputs.\nIn the transportation sector, Kifiya’s Mobility as a Service (MaaS) technology revolutionizes travel booking and payments, providing eco-friendly and convenient travel solutions.\nKifiya’s Insurance Technology (Insurtech) provides a digital marketplace for affordable microinsurance products, ensuring low-income individuals can secure their futures against financial risks.\nRecognizing that innovation can address many development challenges, Kifiya has combined its extensive AI and technology experience with a market system approach to design and implement solutions that target market inefficiencies and failures. Kifiya is utilizing its AI-powered products and data-driven infrastructure to drive the adoption of digital financial services and enable access to financial services and markets, one country at a time.\nMunir Duri emphasized, “Our approach is about more than just technology. We are committed to driving sustainable, inclusive growth by solving systemic challenges that prevent millions of Africans from accessing finance and markets. This award motivates us to continue innovating and expanding our solutions across Africa.”\nThe company’s data-driven technology infrastructure supports financial institutions, smallholder farmers, low-to-middle-income individuals and MSMEs in accessing relevant credit products, reducing costs, and enhancing service delivery.\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects an average 4.0% GDP growth rate for sub-Saharan Africa in 2025. With Africa’s population expected to reach 1.9 billion by 2050, Kifiya’s technology-driven solutions are poised to play a pivotal role in this economic transformation.\nKifiya’s ongoing efforts to address the $400 billion credit gap and unlock market access for 44 million MSMEs and smallholder farmers will be critical to driving economic growth and financial inclusion across Sub-Saharan Africa. With a focus on scaling its innovative products, Kifiya is well-positioned to continue leading the charge in Africa’s digital financial services industry.\nKifiya Financial Technology is an AI-enabled, alternative data-driven scoring and rating company that offers FinTech, AgTech, and mobility solutions.\nThrough innovative AI-powered digital financial services infrastructure, Kifiya empowers MSMEs, smallholder farmers, and low-middle-income consumers by providing uncollateralized credit, connecting them to larger markets, and digitizing critical sectors such as agriculture.\nCommitted to enabling equitable access to financial services and markets, Kifiya leverages AI-powered data and technology for social good, creating a more inclusive and sustainable future.\nFounded in 2010, Kifiya has its headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\nFor more information about Kifiya and its award-winning solutions, visit www.kifiya.com.\nMedia Contact\nKifiya Financial Technology Plc\nDivine Muragijimana\nPhone: +254711455980\nEmail: dmuragijimana@kifiya.com\nEmail: info@kifiya.com\nPhone: +251 116 671 579"

        "title": "Mastercard Foundation and Kifiya Financial Technology PLC to Enable More Than 477,800 MSMEs to Access Uncollateralized Digital Credit Products. - Kifiya Financial Technology",
        "content": "Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, May 2024 – The Mastercard Foundation, in partnership with Kifiya Financial Technology PLC (Kifiya), announces a scale-up program designed to unlock resources from banks, innovate new financial models and products, and transition the financial sector to enable access to uncollateralized financial credit products to a greater number of MSMEs. A budget of US $100 million is committed to the program.\nThe Sustainable Access to Finance to Enable Entrepreneurship (SAFEE) program incorporated learnings from Michu, a successful large-scale pilot by the Cooperative Bank of Oromia, Kifiya, and the Mastercard Foundation. This collaboration enabled more than 148,000 MSMEs to access uncollateralized working capital credit in just 14 months.\nSAFEE will unlock US$300 million from six banks and enable more than 477,800 micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to access relevant and appropriate uncollateralized digital credit products and will enable 425,000 young women access mobile device financing.\nThe program will serve program participants of current and future Foundation programs by unlocking access to uncollateralized working and productive digital credit. The credit is in the form of nano, micro, and small working capital, inventory credit, invoice financing, equipment financing, and buy-now-pay-later products for MSMEs in urban, peri-urban, and rural areas of Ethiopia.\nOver a period of five years, the program will directly drive the creation of job opportunities for 2.18 million young people (80 percent women) and support other programs to enable 3.65 million young people to access credit. The program will focus on supporting vulnerable young people who are traditionally excluded from accessing financial products, including women, persons with disabilities, refugees, and Internally Displaced People (IDPs).\nThe program is designed to propel supply-side system-level change while addressing demand-side challenges that have traditionally constrained MSMEs’ access to uncollateralized financial services. It does this by addressing the lack of credit history and records, availability of appropriate products and services, low use of financial technology and the cost of managing low-value credit. It also provides the technical assistance required for financial institutions to transition from conventional collateral-based lending to uncollateralized, digitally enabled, credit-score-based lending, and embracing new modality of delivery of financial services.\nThe program unlocks resources from banks, innovates new models/products, and ensures that the financial sector transitions to offer uncollateralized financial credit products to a greater number of MSMEs – even beyond the initial program targets.\nSAFEE has initially partnered with the Cooperative Bank of Oromia, Bunna Bank, Enat Bank, Amhara Bank, Wegagen Bank, and ZamZam Bank. The facility will increase the number of bank partnerships based on learnings and needs.\nAccording to the SME Finance Forum, the financing gap for MSMEs in Ethiopia and Sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to be US$4.3 billion and US$331 billion, respectively. MSMEs are major job creators in Africa, contributing to 80 percent of employment, according to McKinsey & Company. It is therefore critical to address the access to finance constraints as an underlying requirement on the pathway for creating and sustaining jobs on the continent.\nThe program replaces the need for collateral by providing alternative data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) credit scoring, which ensures that appropriate and relevant products are tailored to and serve the needs and demands of MSMEs. By using data-driven technology solutions, the costs of finance and management of small-value loans for the banks were reduced. The technical support ensures that banks undergo efficient change management to introduce and deliver the new model and create inclusive access to financial services for MSMEs.\nThe announcement of the SAFEE program was part of the month-long “Startup Ethiopia” event in April 2024, along with the announcement of a series of reforms including access to finance opportunities for start-ups.\n“Our partnership with the Mastercard Foundation will enable the unlocking of uncollateralized productive credit products ranging from digital working capital, invoice financing, inventory credit, buy-now-pay-later, and interest-free banking that address the needs and demands of MSMEs. The program is catalytic by design to enable the financial sector transition through system-level change support where uncollateralized digital credit for MSMEs become the new normal,” said Munir Duri, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Kifiya Financial Technology PLC.\n“Through collaborative efforts and innovative and tailored programs like SAFEE, the Foundation aims to create an ecosystem where MSMEs can harness the power of digital lending to realize their full potential and ensure sustainable livelihoods for fellow young people,” said Samuel Yalew Adela, Mastercard Foundation Country Director, Ethiopia. “These MSMEs will not access financial services through traditional lending approaches otherwise. Including SAFEE, the Foundation to date has committed a total of $672 million in Ethiopia, of which $222 million is dedicated to increasing affordable access to finance through various partnerships.”\nAbout the Mastercard Foundation\nThe Mastercard Foundation is a registered Canadian charity and one of the largest foundations in the world. It works with visionary organizations to advance education and financial inclusion to enable young people in Africa and Indigenous youth in Canada to access dignified and fulfilling work. Established in 2006 through the generosity of Mastercard when it became a public company, the Foundation is an independent organization separate from the company, with offices in Toronto, Kigali, Accra, Nairobi, Kampala, Lagos, Dakar, and Addis Ababa. Its policies, operations, and program decisions are determined by the Foundation’s Board of Directors and leadership.\nFor more information on the Foundation, please visit www.mastercardfdn.org\nAbout Kifiya\nKifiya Financial Technology is an industry-leading financial technology company based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, focused on enabling access to finance and access to markets through data driven digital solutions.

        "content": "On January 12, 2022, Cooperative Bank of Oromia (Coop bank) and Kifiya Financial Technology (Kifiya) announced a new partnership and launched a digital lending product named Michu.\nCoop bank’s Michu is Ethiopia’s first uncollateralized digital lending product, powered by Kifiya’s Qena, AI-driven digital lending platform developed in partnership with Mastercard Foundation.\nThe partnership allows Coop bank to tap into Kifiya’s digital lending technology and give Kifiya ability to leverage Cooperative Bank of Oromia distribution and financial capacity. The Bank will offer lending solutions targeting Micro, Small, and medium businesses (MSMEs), providing access to credit, through groundbreaking and cutting-edge credit scoring systems.\nResearch shows that Ethiopia’s MSME Financing to GDP Ratio was 2% in 2020. This ratio is lower than South Africa’s 14% and Kenya’s 6% in 2020. Ethiopia’s poor ratio is attributed to the crowding-out of credit by the public sector and high requirements for a loan to MSMEs by Micro-Finances and Commercial Banks.\nFinancial institutions place high requirements partly due to a lack of credible credit ratings. Michu’s ease of access enables users to apply for loans and receive decisions based on credit scoring logic. The loan application process from eligibility and verification to analysis, scoring, and loan disbursement gets completed within a few minutes.\n“We are excited to join hands with Kifiya as we expand our digital financial offerings and deliver support to the financing needs of micro and small businesses that are often neglected but represent a significant part of the economy.”, says Deribie Asfaw, President of Cooperative Bank of Oromia.\n“Today’s partnership with Coop bank marks an exciting era for the Ethiopian Digital Economy as Kifiya’s Qena technology heralds uncollateralized digital lending in the country. With the help of our AI-powered credit scoring digital lending platform, we hope to address the needs of uncollateralized finance in MSMEs sector in Ethiopia”, says Munir Duri, CEO of Kifiya Financial Technologies PLC.\nMichu has offerings, both loans in the form of loans and overdraft facilities, for Micro, Small, and Medium Businesses. The Microloans are aimed towards working capital needs of roadside traders and micro businesses with a maximum loan amount of 30,000 ETB and a repayment period of 1-4 months.\nWhereas, the MSME loans targets traders at small and medium levels with a maximum loan amount of 150,000birr and a repayment period of up to one year. Moreover, the loans are intended to cover the working capital of the MSMEs.  Michu also has another product targeted at employees of various organs called Consumer Loan.\nThe non-collateral digital lending product is a new desired loan service that is innovative and makes the loan service process swift, non-collateral, easy to access at anytime and anywhere. The product uses data to determine credit worthiness as well as a flexible payment method.  Michu digital lending product is expected to increase Coop bank borrowers by 30% during the pilot period.\nEmail: info@kifiya.com\nPhone: +251 116 671 579"

        "content": "Kifiya Financial Technology, along with Oromia Insurance Company and Agriculture Transformation Insititute (ATI), have scaled up their micro-insurance product that protects farmers from shocks caused by drought.\nThe product, Vegetation Index Crop Insurance (VICI), first launched in 2016, extended its program for two more years after winning a 2-million euro co-funding grant from the InsuResilience Solutions Fund (ISF).\nScaling up the VICI project will provide micro-insurance to 50,000 smallholder farmers in Oromia and Southern National and Nationalities Regional (SNNP) States to enhance their climate resilience.\nFor many farmers, especially smallholder farmers in rainfed systems, their exposure to weather-related risks like drought is increasing due to climate change.\nVICI offers a basic safety net to protect them against drought using computerized geographical data for an innovative agricultural insurance scheme.\nVICI is a form of drought insurance that is satellite-based and uses the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), an index that measures the greenness and the density of the vegetation captured in a satellite image.\nThe level of greenness is calculated every ten days through remote sensing for the entire period the insurance stands.\nEvery time a farmer signs up for the micro-insurance, their land is registered using longitude and latitude and is given a code that helps Kifiya track its vegetation.\nBy combining this data with other information, such as the rainfall rate, VICI uses a formula to compute the aggregate payout the farmer will receive when droughts happen.\nVICI which plans on insuring cereals, especially wheat, teff, maize, barley, and sorghum, provides farmers with a 50% subsidy on premium payments. Farmers’ pay will be considered 50 percent of the insurance, and the project will match the same amount.\n“If the farmer were to pay 300 birr, the insurance would be considered as a 600-birr insurance, and we would cover the remaining 300,” says Megerssa Miressa, director of micro-insurance program at Kifiya Financial Technology.\nWhen droughts happen, farmers will be entitled to insurance proceeds, with a maximum payout of the premium payment plus a 15pc add-on. (Premium divided by 0.15 )\nIn VICI, which brings many players together, Kifiya is the InsurTech provider and project leader, Oromia Insurance Company is the risk taker, and ATI is the public partner. Meanwhile, the University of Twente in the Netherlands provides the satellite images to Kifiya.\nIn the past, VICI has been implemented in Tigray, Oromia, Amhara, and SNNPR, working with Ethiopian Insurance Company and Oromia Insurance Company to insure farmers.\nSince 2016, over 16,000 farmers have been insured through this program, and more than 6,000 have received a payout, totaling 2.5 million birr in insurance payouts.\nTo scale the product, the partnership signed an agreement with InsuResilience Solutions Fund (ISF), which promotes the development of innovative and sustainable climate risk insurance products in developing and emerging countries.\nISF which is financed by Germany’s KfW Development Bank is co-funding the product development and implementation of the solution.\nKifiya is also working on a platform where farmers can register through a mobile app and the data is uploaded to a cloud to which the insurance companies have access. Through the app, VICI can make payouts to farmers, or the insurance company can transfer money directly to farmers’ bank accounts.\nIn addition, the cloud micro-insurance platform supports insurance companies in digitally managing insurance policies and claims, helping to reduce operational administration costs.\nTo reach the farmers, Kifiya plans on establishing 500 agents who will register the farmers and accept premiums through mobile devices with an application provided to them through the project.\nThey also plan on hiring 500 insurance promoters who will provide information and educate smallholders about the insurance options available.\nSmallholder farms indirectly support about 70 percent of the population and contribute to more than 40 percent of the country’s GDP.\nFrequent droughts in Ethiopia, caused by climate change, have been leading to massive food insecurities. According to the UNHCR Ethiopia is currently experiencing one of the most severe La Niña-induced droughts in the last forty years following four consecutive failed rainy seasons since late 2020.\nEmail: info@kifiya.com\nPhone: +251 116 671 579"

        "content": "Addis Ababa, Ethiopia – March 2025: Small businesses are the backbone of economies across emerging markets, from Africa to Asia to Latin America, yet many struggle to access financing. Traditional lending models, which rely on collateral and formal credit histories, exclude millions of entrepreneurs, particularly women, micro-enterprises, and informal businesses. AI-powered credit scoring is transforming financial access by using alternative data sources—such as mobile transactions, business performance, and digital footprints—to assess creditworthiness, eliminating barriers that have long hindered small business growth.\nAt a recent workshop in Dhaka, Bangladesh, titled “AI-Powered Credit Scoring and Micro-Loans for Women-Led Small Businesses,” financial leaders, development organisations, and technology experts explored how AI-driven credit scoring can revolutionise SME financing. Hosted by institutions like the SME Foundation, The Asia Foundation, and the SheProspers project, the event featured Bangladesh Bank Governor Dr. Ahsan H. Mansur and Munir Duri, CEO of Kifiya Financial Technology, as keynote speakers. Kifiya, a leader in AI-driven lending in Ethiopia, showcased how its data-driven financial inclusion model has successfully provided credit to MSMEs without collateral, a model that could be replicated across Bangladesh, Southeast Asia, and beyond.\nBangladesh offers a strong parallel to Africa. The SME Foundation has allocated Tk450 crore through 23 banks and financial institutions, with 30% of loans directed to women entrepreneurs, proving that AI-driven lending is already reshaping financial access. Similar challenges—high collateral requirements, complex loan processes, and economic data limitations—continue to exclude entrepreneurs across Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana, Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania, Senegal, and South Africa. AI-powered credit scoring addresses these challenges by evaluating creditworthiness through machine learning and alternative data, removing the need for collateral and expanding access to financing.\nIn Ethiopia, Kifiya has demonstrated the power of AI-driven lending, facilitating $150 million in uncollateralised digital credit for 382,000 MSMEs, with a 12% month-to-month growth rate. In partnership with six banks, Kifiya has enabled 717,000 loans worth $44 million, proving that data-driven lending models can scale. Beyond MSMEs, 75,000 smallholder farmers have accessed $92 million in agricultural inputs and credit, strengthening food security and rural productivity. These successes highlight the potential for AI-powered financial inclusion across emerging economies.\nGovernments, financial institutions, fintech innovators, and development organisations must collaborate to build a global framework for AI-driven financial inclusion to accelerate this transformation. Policymakers must support regulatory environments that ensure responsible AI-based lending while protecting consumers. Banks and fintech companies must scale AI models to make SME financing more efficient and accessible. NGOs and development agencies are critical in financial literacy and digital adoption, ensuring that underserved communities can fully benefit. With the right partnerships, shared knowledge, and bold action, AI-powered credit scoring can unlock prosperity for millions—transforming economies, strengthening communities, and creating a more inclusive global financial system.\nEmail: info@kifiya.com\nPhone: +251 116 671 579"

        "content": "Source https://www.thereporterethiopia.com/771/#google_vignette\nFour years after building the mechanism for a unified billing system for basic government services such as payment on electricity and water in ‘Lehulu’ in a pioneering private-public-partnership (PPP) Kifiya Financial Technology is teaming up with MasterCard. The plan is to integrate and serve the resources of an ever-expanding Ethiopian diaspora in a digital driven way.\nThis new partnership coincided with the digital Ethiopia conference that runs until tomorrow and where one of the key themes discussed was digital finance. Kifiya hopes the new partnership will produce an affordable and convenient way to serve international clients.\nAt the conference, there was a concentrated discussion on an industry that is fast becoming fragmented that is being pushed by various players. The key theme was the need to develop the ecosystem in Ethiopia that connects various stakeholders in the digital payment space.\nMunir Duri of Kifiya and Lehulu was a moderator and hosted industry players such as Amaha Bekele of Deloitte and Peter Gichangi from Safaricom. The gathering heard the noted successes from the East African region specifically of Mpesa, the global renowned mobile payment platform in Kenya were explained. With individuals and the fintechs and financial institutions driving their own agenda, industry experts raised their concern around getting an oversight committee to drive the strategic direction the country should be driving.\nIt was noted how cash is still the conventional method of payment in Ethiopia where 95 percent of the population still uses.\nThe new partnership of Kifiya and MasterCard was one of the most talked about topic at the conference. Industry experts are challenging why the company is choosing to team up with one of the leading technology companies in the world, blocking banks that do not issue MasterCard cards from being players in the remittance industry now worth billions. Some are also voicing concern the need for an international clearing route, when Ethiopia has just launched a national switch in the country.\n“MasterCard and digital financial service provider Kifiya has partnered to introduce first of its kind consumer to business remittance to pay digital payment platform focusing on Africa with the first toll out in Ethiopia,” Kifiya said.\nHowever, while the company preached of cash-less society, it still only accepts cash as a payment.\n“Lehulu experience is not a success. Basically it has been done to facilitate and avoid queue in public institutions. But what were done was just the locations but the queue remained,” an observer at the conference told The Reporter. No technology has been introduced that have changed the clients’ experience.”\nSome are also questioning why banks and financial institutions such as Premier Switch Solutions (PSS) or Eth-Switch still not allowed to process utility payments. The new system is also authorizing Kifiya to partake in the remittance business that was once monopolized by banks and not any other private institutions.\n“The merchants are all required by the Ethiopian Revenues and Customs Authority (ERCA) to have electronic cash register with internet connection, so a part of the infrastructure is already there,” an industry player told The Reporter. “Why don’t we encourage added values creations to the merchants so that we can build our next financial ecosystem instead of going for specific agents? ERCA as main stakeholder should push for this type of innovation,” he said.\n“There will be changes coming to Lehulu and we will soon be accepting digital payment in three months,” Elfagid Aregahegne, digital payment manager at Kifiya, told The Reporter. “There has been a new eco-system allowing us to move forward with new method of payments.”\n“Customer adoption, development of telecom infrastructures and banks investment in technology which will allow Lehulu to move towards digital payment,” he said.\nEmail: info@kifiya.com\nPhone: +251 116 671 579"

Users are to download the application and register using their ID club numbers.\nThe club has embarked on the project with the main aim of creating efficiency and accessibility, according to Yohannes Barnabas, an IT expert and technical advisor to St George.\n“The team will benefit from the system financially by widening its fan base,” Yohannes told Fortune.\nKifiya, a payment service provider which has invested over 200 million Br since its establishment in 2010, will receive one Birr from every transaction.\nSince the launch of the new application, a total of 1,000 people have registered, according to Abenezer Wondwossen, product support manager of Kifiya, which employs a total of 735 employees including 40 senior managers.\n“On a daily basis, 50 to 60 people are registering,” said Abenezer.\nHaider Abrar, a member of St. George Sports Club for three years, has already registered on the system hoping the hassle to pay membership fees and buy club accessories will be alleviated.\n“The club has only one branch from which it handles all transactions, and the service was inefficient,” said Haider.\nOne of 16 football clubs in the National Premier League and the only club with more than 60 trophies, St. George claims 35,000 members across the country.\nSupporters who do not use the mobile application can go to one of 10,000 Kifiya agents to conduct the transactions. Fans can also use Kifya Wallet Card, a debit card that is expected to be launched next April, as another alternative.\nThough the membership registration started three weeks ago, all transactions are expected to start on March 30, according to Yohannes.\n“In the meantime, we will aggressively promote the platform to attract many users.”\nA prominent football commentator for the past decade, Mensur Abdulikeni, commends the agreement between Kifiya and the club.\n“Football clubs in Ethiopia are weak in their financial status and ability to monitise their sport merchandising business,” commented Mensur. “Digital platforms have the potential to accelerate these side of the business.”\nRecently, the club announced that it is going to establish a share company and issue public shares in a bid to raise close to half a billion Birr.\nTwo years ago, Kifiya partnered with the Ethiopian Football Federation to automate booking and ticketing services of Yidnekachew Tessema Stadium, known parochially as the Addis Abeba Stadium.\nAlong with the new payment system, Kifiya has been the sole venue of all electronic public utility payment services including telecom, water, electricity and traffic fines and under its one-stop billing system Lehulu.\nBut recently government institutions started diverting their e-payment services away from Kifiya to a new electronic platform launched by Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE) to accept utility payments. Ethiopian Electric Utilities and Ethio telecom have already started to switch their e-payment system away from Kifiya to CBE, and the transfer is expected to be completed by the end of this fiscal year.\nKifiya is still distributing mobile cards bearing metered telephone and online access as an agent of Ethio telecom. On a monthly basis, Kifiya disburses 250 million mobile cards through its 15 distribution centres.\nThe company has designed other payment systems, one of them is Mela, used by the Ethiopian diaspora to remit payments to pay bills, such as insurance and school fees, in support of relatives residing in Ethiopia. The other platform, YeneGuzo, is an electronic ticketing system used for cross country transportation.\n“We are planning to launch an electronic commerce system before the end of this fiscal year,” Frezer Alemu, chief e-com and distribution officer of Kifiya, told Fortune.\nEmail: info@kifiya.com\nPhone: +251 116 671 579"
